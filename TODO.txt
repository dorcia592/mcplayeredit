This is a list of things which still need work in MCPlayerEdit.

- Error on save when stack size > 127

	Testing> give 128 diamond shovel
	Added 128 x Diamond Shovel in slot 0
	Testing> save
	/home/todsah/Development/mcplayeredit/lib/nbt.py:80: DeprecationWarning: 'b' format requires -128 <= number <= 127
	buf.write(struct.pack(self.fmt, self.value))
	Saved. Backup created (/home/todsah/.minecraft/saves/Testing/level.dat.bak)

- Fix %%VERSION%% replacement on release buildrule.

- autocomplete needs work
  * Tab completion does not take safe-mode in account.
  * Values with spaces are not quoted/escaped properly.
  * Autocomplete on mac
  * completing 'kit' doesn't show 'kitsave'.

- autocomplete on world files

- give/kit will put items in armor slots even if they're not supposed to go
  there. Safemode should allow the user to do this though.

- Watch level.dat for changes? Is this possible? I think not.

- Detect lock to see if the player is currently playing the world, and tell
  him/her to quit before making changes. Automatically reload if possible. Is
  this possible? I think not.

- Generic 'Confirm' method.

- Add commandline parameters:(optparse)
  * -w, --world  World to open
  * -s (ON/OFF), --safemode (ON/OFF)  Save mode on or off
  * Silent mode
  * Batch mode? (read commands from stdin)
