   your inventory.
 - Moving the player to the spawn point now takes in account the
   dimension.  (You cannot move the spawn point between dimensions)
 - Bookmarking places and warping to them is now possible between
   dimensions.
 - The `position` command now shows the dimension the player is in.

   living. This is mostly a workaround for the bug in the Halloween
   update that causes you to lose your inventory. It's kind of iffy
   at the moment, please read the `help trackinv` help!
